  <p>Andrew Barron &quot;Andy&quot; Murray, OBE (born 15 May 1987) is a Scottish professional tennis player

currently ranked world No. 1 in men&#39;s singles.[6] Murray represents Great Britain in his sporting

activities and is a three-time Grand Slam tournament winner, two-time Olympic champion and

Davis Cup champion. He was first ranked as British No. 1 on 27 February 2006. He achieved a

top-10 ranking by the ATP for the first time on 16 April 2007. Following his run to the final of the

2016 Paris Masters, Murray became world No. 1 on 7 November 2016, as the first new player to

top the rankings since Novak Djokovic in 2011.[12]

At the 2012 US Open, Murray became the first British player since 1977, and the first British man

since 1936, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament, when he defeated Novak Djokovic in the

final, a feat that earned him a third-place trophy in the BBC Sport&#39;s Personality of the Year awards.

In July 2013, Murray won the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, becoming the first British player to

win a Wimbledon senior singles title since Virginia Wade in 1977, and the first British man to win

the men&#39;s singles title since Fred Perry, 77 years previously. In 2016, he won his second

Wimbledon title to become the first British man to win multiple Wimbledon singles titles since Perry

in 1935.[13]

Murray is the men&#39;s singles 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medallist, defeating Roger Federer in the

2012 final and Juan Mart√≠n del Potro in the 2016 final. He is the only tennis player, male or female,

to have won two Olympic singles titles.

He featured in Great Britain&#39;s Davis Cup-winning team in 2015, going 11-0 in his matches (8

singles and 3 doubles) as they secured their first Davis Cup title since 1936.[14] He partnered with

his older brother, Jamie, in the doubles. Following his first Wimbledon title in 2013, Murray was

voted the 2013 BBC Sports Personality of the Year. He repeated the feat in 2015, while the Davis

Cup team won the BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award.</p>
