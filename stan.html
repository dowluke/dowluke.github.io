  <p>Stanislas &quot;Stan&quot; Wawrinka (French: [vavʁiŋka]; born 28 March 1985) is a Swiss professional tennis

player. He reached a career-high Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 3 singles

ranking for the first time on January 27, 2014.[1] His career highlights include three Grand Slam

titles at the 2014 Australian Open, 2015 French Open and 2016 US Open, where he defeated the

world No. 1 player in all 3 finals; and a ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title at the Monte-Carlo

Masters in 2014, as well as 2 other finals at the 2008 Rome Masters and 2009 Madrid Masters.

Wawrinka considers clay his best surface and his serve and backhand his best shots. John

McEnroe once said that Wawrinka has one of the most powerful backhands ever, and in 2009

described him as having &quot;the best one-handed backhand in the game.&quot;[2] He has been described

by The Economist as &quot;Tennis’s great latecomer&quot;, due to finding success later in his career.[3] Prior

to the 2014 French Open, he requested and the ATP granted a formal change in his name from

&quot;Stanislas Wawrinka&quot; to &quot;Stan Wawrinka&quot;, stating that he plans to use the abbreviated name in

tournament draws and press conferences.[4]</p>
