  <p>Maria Yuryevna Sharapova (Russian: Мари́я Ю́рьевна Шара́пова; IPA: [mɐˈrʲijə ˈjʉrʲjɪvnə

ʂɐˈrapəvə]; born April 19, 1987) is a Russian professional tennis player. A United States resident

since 1994,[4] Sharapova has competed on the WTA tour since 2001. She has been ranked world

No. 1 in singles by the WTA on five separate occasions, for a total of 21 weeks. She is one of ten

women, and the only Russian, to hold the career Grand Slam. She is also an Olympic medalist,

having earned silver for Russia in women&#39;s singles at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

Sharapova became the world No. 1 for the first time on August 22, 2005, at the age of 18, and last

held the ranking for the fifth time for four weeks from June 11, 2012, to July 8, 2012.[5][6] Her 35

singles titles and five Grand Slam titles—two at the French Open and one each at the Australian

Open, Wimbledon, and US Open—rank third among active players, behind Serena and Venus

Williams. She won the year-ending WTA Finals in her debut in 2004. She has also won three

doubles titles.

Despite an injury-prone career, Sharapova has achieved a rare level of longevity in the women&#39;s

game. She has won at least one singles title a year from 2003 until 2015, a streak only bested by

Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, and Chris Evert. Several tennis pundits and former players have

called Sharapova one of tennis&#39;s best competitors, with John McEnroe calling her one of the best

the sport has ever seen.[7]

Sharapova has been featured in a number of modeling assignments, including a feature in the

Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. She appeared in many advertisements, including those for Nike,

Prince, and Canon, being the face of several fashion houses, most notably Cole Haan. Since

February 2007, she has been a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador,

concerned specifically with the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme. In June 2011,

she was named one of the &quot;30 Legends of Women&#39;s Tennis: Past, Present and Future&quot; by Time[8]

and in March 2012 was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest of All Time&quot; by Tennis Channel. According

to Forbes, she has been named highest paid female athlete in the world for 11 consecutive years

and earned US$285 million including prize money since she turned pro in 2001.[9][10]

In March 2016, Sharapova revealed she had failed a drug test at the 2016 Australian Open,

admitting to testing positive for meldonium, a substance banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency

(WADA) at the start of 2016. On June 8, 2016, she was suspended from playing tennis for two

years by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).[11][12][13] On October 4 2016, the suspension

was reduced to 15 months.[14] [15]</p>
