  <p>Raonic first gained international acclaim by reaching the fourth round of the 2011 Australian Open

as a qualifier, being referred to as &quot;the real deal&quot;,[5] &quot;a new star&quot;,[6] part of &quot;a new generation&quot;,[7]

and &quot;a future superstar&quot;.[8] Coupled with his first ATP World Tour title three weeks later, his world

ranking rose from No. 152 to No. 37 in one month. He was awarded the 2011 ATP Newcomer of

the Year, and has been ranked continuously inside the top 20 since August 2012. Raonic is the first

player born in the 1990s to win an ATP World Tour title, to be ranked in the top 10, and to qualify

for the ATP World Tour Finals. He has eight ATP World Tour titles.

Raonic is the most successful Canadian singles player in history. He became the highest-ranked

Canadian male ever on February 21, 2011, when he reached world No. 37. His career-high world

No. 4 ranking is the highest by a Canadian man or woman. He is the first Canadian male in the

Open Era to reach the Australian Open semifinals, the French Open quarterfinals, and the

Wimbledon final. He has more ATP World Tour titles and finals appearances in the Open Era than

all other Canadian men combined.[a]

Raonic is frequently described as having one of the best serves among his

contemporaries.[10][11][12][13] Statistically, Raonic is among the strongest servers in the Open

Era, winning 91% of service games to rank third all-time. Aided by his serve, he plays an all-court

style with an emphasis on short points. Every one of his singles titles has been won on hard courts.</p>
