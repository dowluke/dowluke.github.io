  <p>Roberta Vinci (Italian pronunciation: [roˈbɛrta ˈvintʃi]; born 18 February 1983) is an Italian tennis

player. Up until 6 April 2015, she held the position of World No. 1 in doubles, whilst reaching a

career-high of World No. 7 in singles in May 2016.[1] She is the fourth Italian woman to have

reached the top 10 in singles, together with Flavia Pennetta, Francesca Schiavone and Sara

Errani. At 33 years and 4 days old, she is also the oldest ever player to make her first appearance

in the Top 10.

She rose to worldwide prominence at the 2015 US Open, when she reached the semi-finals and

defeated world number one Serena Williams in three sets, ending Williams&#39;s hopes of winning the

Calendar Grand Slam, in what has been described by numerous commentators as one of the

biggest shocks in tennis history.[2] She went on to lose to Flavia Pennetta in the first ever all-Italian

Grand Slam final.

Vinci has won 35 WTA Tour titles, 10 in singles and 25 in doubles, including the 2012 French

Open, the 2012 US Open,[3] the 2013 Australian Open and 2014 Australian Open, and 2014

Wimbledon titles with regular partner Sara Errani. In doing so, they became only the fifth pair in

tennis history to complete a Career Grand Slam.

To date she has won 10 WTA singles titles. Her first title came in the 2007 Copa Colsanitas, over

Tathiana Garbin. She won her second title at the 2009 Barcelona Ladies Open, over Maria

Kirilenko. Her third title was at the 2010 BGL Luxembourg Open, over Julia Görges. Her fourth title

was for her second victory after 2009 at the 2011 Barcelona Ladies Open, over Lucie Hradecká.

Her fifth title was her first win on grass at the 2011 UNICEF Open, over Jelena Dokić. Her third

victory in 2011 and sixth title was in Budapest over Irina-Camelia Begu. In 2012, at Dallas, over

former world no.1 Jelena Janković for her 7th title. In 2013, she defeated Petra Kvitová for her 8th

title at the 2013 BNP Paribas Katowice Open and doubles partner Sara Errani at Palermo. Her

biggest title came in 2016, when she won the Premier event in St. Petersburg, defeating Belinda

Bencic in the final.

She and her Italian teammates Mara Santangelo, Flavia Pennetta, and Francesca Schiavone beat

the Belgian team 3–2 in the 2006 Fed Cup final. Justine Henin-Hardenne had to retire in the fifth

and final match due to an injury in her right knee, which allowed Italy to win their first Fed Cup

trophy.[4] With the Italian team, she also won the Fed-Cup in 2009 and 2010 against the USA.

At the 2012 US Open, Vinci reached her first Grand Slam quarter-final, at 29 years of age, by

defeating then-World No. 2 Agnieszka Radwańska in the fourth round.[5] She subsequently lost to

her doubles partner and World No. 10 Sara Errani in the quarter-finals.[6] She achieved the same

feat the following year when she defeated Camila Giorgi in the fourth round. She subsequently lost

to Flavia Pennetta.</p>
