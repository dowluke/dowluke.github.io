  <p>Tomáš Berdych (Czech pronunciation: [ˈtomaːʃ ˈbɛrdɪx]; born 17 September 1985) is a Czech

professional tennis player. His most notable achievement was reaching the final of the 2010

Wimbledon Championships, causing consecutive upsets by defeating top seed and six-time

champion Roger Federer in the quarterfinals, and world No. 3 Novak Djokovic in the semifinals. In

the final, he lost to Rafael Nadal in straight sets. Berdych&#39;s biggest career win to date was the

Paris Masters in 2005 as an unseeded player, defeating Ivan Ljubicic in the final.

Berdych has reached the semifinals of all four Grand Slams. Alongside his Wimbledon

performance in the same year, he reached the semifinals of the 2010 French Open, defeating

fourth seed Andy Murray in straight sets in the fourth round, and dropping no sets until his loss in

the semifinals to Robin Söderling.[2] At the 2012 US Open he defeated world No. 1 Roger Federer,

again at the quarterfinal stage, before losing to eventual champion Murray. During the 2014

Australian Open he lost to eventual champion Stanislas Wawrinka in four sets during the semi. He

is the second player (after David Nalbandian) to defeat Roger Federer multiple times in Grand

Slam events before the semifinal stage. He has the distinction of being one of three players, the

others being Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Stan Wawrinka, to defeat all the Big Four in major events.

As well as his Paris Masters win, Berdych has reached the finals of the Miami Masters in 2010,

Madrid Open in 2012 and Monte Carlo Masters in 2015. He first reached his career-high singles

ranking of World No. 4 in May 2015.

He also played the longest ATP doubles match ever, with Lukáš Rosol, defeating Marco Chiudinelli

and Stanislas Wawrinka in the first round of the 2013 Davis Cup 6–4, 5–7, 6–4, 6–7, 24–22. The

match was played on 2 February 2013, lasting 7 hours, 2 minutes. It was the second longest ATP

match ever (singles and doubles combined).</p>
