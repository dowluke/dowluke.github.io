  <p>Petra Kvitová (Czech pronunciation: [ˈpɛtra ˈkvɪtovaː]; born 8 March 1990) is a Czech professional

tennis player. Having turned professional in 2006, she is known for her powerful left-handed

groundstrokes and variety. Kvitová has won nineteen career singles titles including two Grand

Slam titles at Wimbledon. In addition to that, she is also an Olympic bronze medallist, having won

the medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics. She reached her career-high ranking of world no. 2 on 31

October 2011 and is ranked world no. 13 by the Women&#39;s Tennis Association (WTA) as of 31

October 2016. As such, Kvitová is the current second highest-ranked Czech and the second

highest-ranked left-handed player in the WTA behind Karolína Plíšková and Germany&#39;s Angelique

Kerber respectively.

Kvitová first gained notice upon defeating then-world no. 1 Dinara Safina in the third round of the

2009 US Open. This was followed by her first Grand Slam semifinal appearance at the 2010

Wimbledon Championships where she came up short to eventual champion Serena Williams.

Then, during her breakthrough season in 2011, Kvitová won her first Grand Slam title at the

Wimbledon Championships, defeating Maria Sharapova in the final, thus becoming the first Grand

Slam event winner of either gender born in the 1990s. She also won the WTA Tour

Championships, thus becoming the third player to win the tournament on debut, the others being

Williams and Sharapova. She also helped lead the Czech Republic to victory in the Fed Cup final

that same year. It was the Czech Republic&#39;s first Fed Cup title as an independent nation.

In 2012, Kvitová made the semifinals of the Australian Open and the French Open and was also

crowned US Open Series champion. That same year, she also won the Hopman Cup alongside

Tomáš Berdych which was the Czech Republic&#39;s second and most recent Hopman Cup title. In

2014, Kvitová won her second and most recent Grand Slam title at the Wimbledon Championships,

defeating Eugenie Bouchard in the final. She then made her first quarterfinal at the US Open the

following year, thus achieving the feat of making the quarterfinals at all four Grand Slams. In 2016,

Kvitová won the WTA Elite Trophy in her first appearance at the tournament, thus becoming the

first player to win both categories of year-ending championships on debut.</p>
