<p>Agnieszka "Aga" Radwańska[3] [aɡˈɲɛʂka raˈdvaɲska] (born 6 March 1989) is a Polish professional tennis player. Radwańska achieved a career-high singles ranking of world No. 2 in July 2012 and is currently ranked world No. 3 by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA). Known for constructing points and making intelligent use of the court,[4][5][6] she has won twenty career singles titles, and is nicknamed "The Professor" among players and the media.[7][8]

Radwańska holds a number of tennis accolades. She is the first Polish player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam singles final (the 2012 Wimbledon Championships), the first Pole to win the WTA Finals (in 2015), the first Pole to claim a WTA singles title (the 2007 Nordea Nordic Light Open), and was one half of the first Polish team to win the Hopman Cup tournament. In addition, she won the WTA Award for Most Impressive Newcomer in 2006.

Radwańska has been voted the WTA's Fan Favorite Singles Player for five consecutive years (2011–2015), the most of any player, in polls held by WTATennis.com.[9] For her accomplishments in sport and for representing her country with distinction, in 2013 she was awarded the Gold Cross of Merit by Polish President Bronisław Komorowski.
