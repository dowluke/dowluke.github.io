<p>Belinda Bencic (born 10 March 1997) is a Swiss tennis player, currently ranked world No. 26.

Bencic has won two singles and two doubles titles on the WTA tour, as well as two singles and two

In 2012, Bencic made her debut for the Switzerland Fed Cup team,[1] and in 2013 won the French

Open and Wimbledon girls&#39; singles titles.[2] She has also been a finalist in three girls&#39; doubles

tournaments, at the US Open in 2012 and 2013, as well as at Wimbledon in 2012. Bencic&#39;s run to

the quarterfinals at the 2014 US Open, defeating two top-ten players, including former world No. 1

Jelena Janković along the way, propelled her into the top 40 for the first time in her career.[3] In

2015, Bencic won her first title at the Aegon International, beating Agnieszka Radwańska in the

final as well as breaking into the top 20. She won the biggest title of her career at the Rogers Cup,

beating four top-ten players: Caroline Wozniacki, Ana Ivanovic, world No. 1, Serena Williams, and

Bencic is coached by her father, who emigrated to Switzerland from Czechoslovakia in 1968,[1]

 and on occasion by Melanie Molitor,[2] the mother of fellow Swiss tennis player Martina Hingis.</p>
