  <p>Novak Djokovic (Serbian: Новак Ђоковић, Novak Đoković, pronounced [nôʋaːk d͡ʑôːkoʋit͡ɕ]; born 22 May 1987),

often referred to by the hypocoristic Nole,[4] is a Serbian professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No.

2 in men&#39;s singles tennis by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).[5] He is considered one of the greatest

tennis players of all time.[a] He is coached by former Slovak tennis player Marián Vajda and former German tennis

player and six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker. Djokovic holds the best match winning rate (83.00%) in

Open Era, as of August 2016.[18]

Djokovic has won 12 Grand Slam singles titles, the fourth most in history, and held the No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings

for a total of 223 weeks. In majors, Djokovic has won six Australian Open titles, three Wimbledon titles, two US Open

titles and one French Open title. In 2016, he became the eighth player in history to achieve the Career Grand Slam;

by winning the 2016 French Open, Djokovic became the third man to hold all four major titles at once, the first since

Rod Laver in 1969,[19] and the first ever to do so on three different surfaces.[20]

Djokovic stands alone with an all-time record of 30 Masters 1000 series titles. Djokovic&#39;s records include breaking the

single-season record with six masters titles in 2015, winning 31 consecutive ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series

matches, playing in the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (shared with Roger Federer and Rafael

Nadal), and being the only player to win eight of the nine events (and at least twice).[21][22] Among other titles, he

has won the ATP World Tour Finals five times and was on the Serbian team which won the 2010 Davis Cup. He also

won the Bronze medal in men&#39;s singles at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Djokovic is the first Serbian player to be ranked No. 1 by the ATP and the first male player representing Serbia to win

a Grand Slam singles title. Djokovic has won numerous awards, including the 2012, 2015, and 2016 Laureus World

Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year,[23] 2011 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, five-time ITF World

Champion, and four-time ATP year-end number 1. He is a recipient of the Order of St. Sava,[24] the Order of

Karađorđe&#39;s Star[25] and the Order of the Republika Srpska.[26]</p>
