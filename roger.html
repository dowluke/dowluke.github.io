  <p>Roger Federer[3] (born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently

ranked world No. 16 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).[4] His accomplishments in

professional tennis have led to him being regarded by many as the greatest tennis player of all

time.[a] Federer turned professional in 1998 and was continuously ranked in the top 10 from

October 2002 to November 2016.

Federer holds several records of the Open Era: holding the world No. 1 position for 302

weeks[18][19] (including 237 consecutive weeks);[20] winning 17 Grand Slam singles titles;

reaching each Grand Slam final at least five times (an all-time record); and reaching the

Wimbledon final ten times. He is among the eight men (and among the five in Open Era) to capture

a career Grand Slam. Federer shares an Open Era record for most titles at Wimbledon with Pete

Sampras (seven) and at the US Open with Jimmy Connors and Sampras (five). He is the only male

player to win five consecutive US Open titles.

Federer has reached 27 men&#39;s singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 in a row from the 2005

Wimbledon Championships to the 2007 US Open, both statistics being records. He also appeared

in 18 of 19 finals from the 2005 Wimbledon through to the 2010 Australian Open. He reached the

semifinals at 23 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, from the 2004 Wimbledon Championships

through the 2010 Australian Open.[21] At the 2016 Wimbledon Championships, he reached a

record 48th Grand Slam quarterfinal and a record 40th Grand Slam semifinal. Earlier at the 2016

Australian Open, he played in a record 65th consecutive Grand Slam tournament. Earlier at the

2015 US Open, he reached a record 27th Grand Slam final. Also earlier at the 2013 French Open,

Federer reached a record 36th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal. Federer has won the most

matches in Grand Slam events (307) and is the first to record 65+ wins at each Grand Slam

tournament.

Federer&#39;s ATP tournament records include winning a record six ATP World Tour Finals, playing in

the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (a record shared with Djokovic and Nadal). He

also won the Olympic gold medal in doubles with his compatriot Stan Wawrinka at the 2008

Summer Olympic Games and the Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2012 Summer Olympic

Games. Representing Switzerland, he was a part of the 2014 winning Davis Cup team. He finished

eight consecutive years (2003–2010) in one of the top two positions in the year-end men&#39;s

rankings and ten (2003–2012) in the top three. He was named the Laureus World Sportsman of

the Year for a record four consecutive years (2005–2008).</p>
