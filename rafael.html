  <p>Rafael &quot;Rafa&quot; Nadal Parera (Catalan: [rəfəˈɛɫ nəˈðaɫ pəˈɾeɾə], Spanish: [rafaˈel naˈðal

paˈɾeɾa][citation needed]; born 3 June 1986) is a Spanish professional tennis player currently

ranked world No. 8.[3] He is widely regarded as the greatest clay-court player in history,[a] and

owing to his dominance and success on the surface, he has been titled &quot;The King of Clay&quot;.[b] His

evolution into an all-court threat has established him as one of the greatest players in tennis

history,[c] with some considering Nadal to be the greatest player of all time.[28]

Nadal has won 14 Grand Slam singles titles, the 2008 Olympic gold medal in singles, 28 titles in

ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events,[29][30][31] and 17 ATP World Tour 500 tournaments (a

record tied with Roger Federer). He was also a member of the winning Spain Davis Cup team in

2004, 2008, 2009, and 2011. In 2010, he became the seventh player in history and youngest of

four in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam at age 24. He is the second male player,

after Andre Agassi, to complete the singles Career Golden Slam. In 2011, Nadal was named the

Laureus World Sportsman of the Year.[32] The left-hander is the sixth player in the Open Era to

reach more than 100 finals on the ATP World Tour.

Nadal and Mats Wilander are the only two male players in history who have won at least two

Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces—hard court, grass, and clay.[33] By winning the 2014

French Open, Nadal became the third player to win a single Grand Slam tournament nine times

(Martina Navratilova 9, Margaret Court 11) and the first to win at least one Grand Slam tournament

for ten consecutive years, breaking the record of eight consecutive years previously shared by

Björn Borg, Pete Sampras, and Roger Federer. Nadal holds the record after winning his eighth

straight Monte-Carlo Masters in 2012 and is the only player in the open era to achieve such a feat.

Nadal is the only male player in tennis history to win one Grand Slam and Masters 1000 title for ten

consecutive years from 2005–2014. He equalled Guillermo Vilas&#39;s all-time record of 49 clay court

titles by winning the Barcelona Open in 2016.

career-high Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 4 singles ranking on May 11,

2015. His career highlights include a Grand Slam final at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships; two

Grand Slam semifinals at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships and 2016 Australian Open; and

three ATP World Tour Masters 1000 finals at the 2013 Canadian Open, 2014 Paris Masters, and
